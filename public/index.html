<h2>🔥 What This Site Is About</h2>
<p>
This website is the official deck submission and archive site for the akomiya YouTube channel.
On the channel, AI reviews real Clash Royale decks sent in by viewers and evaluates them in detail.
</p>

<p>
The AI looks at things like card synergy, elixir balance, offensive power, defensive stability, and how well the win condition is supported. It’s not just about giving a score — it’s about explaining why a deck works, where it struggles, and what could be improved.
</p>

<p>
This site was created because sending screenshots or random text was messy and unreliable.
Here, decks are submitted in a clean and structured format, making it easier for AI to analyze them fairly and consistently.
</p>

<p>
It also works as an archive of decks that have already appeared in akomiya videos, so you can study past builds anytime.
</p>

<h2>🧭 How to Use This Website</h2>

<h3>1. Open the Deck Builder</h3>
<p>
Click the button that opens the deck builder. That’s where all interactive features are available.
</p>

<h3>2. Log In</h3>
<p>
When you enter the builder, you’ll be asked to input your name. This is just a display name used to label your decks.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No account registration</li>
  <li>No password</li>
  <li>No personal data stored on the server</li>
  <li>Your private decks stay in your own browser</li>
</ul>

<p>
The login system is intentionally simple so anyone can start immediately.
</p>

<h3>3. Build Your Deck</h3>
<p>
You can build your deck visually using real Clash Royale cards.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select a slot</li>
  <li>Click a card to place it</li>
  <li>Evo cards are restricted automatically</li>
  <li>Hero / Champion cards are limited to valid slots</li>
  <li>Illegal decks are blocked in real time</li>
  <li>Average elixir is calculated instantly</li>
</ul>

<p>
This makes it easy to build a legal deck without manually checking rules.
</p>

<h3>4. My Decks (Private Storage)</h3>
<p>
When you are in My Deck mode, saved decks are stored locally in your own browser.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only you can see your saved decks</li>
  <li>You can copy, load, and delete them freely</li>
  <li>They remain even after reloading the page</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is useful for keeping ladder decks, tournament decks, or experimental ideas.
</p>

<h3>5. Submitting a Deck for Review</h3>

</p>

<ul>
  <li>All 8 slots must be filled</li>

  <li>Press Submit</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once submitted, your deck is uploaded to the server and may appear in a future akomiya video if selected.
</p>

<h3>6. Studying Past Decks</h3>
<p>
Decks that appeared in earlier videos are kept here as an archive. You can use them as references to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand meta structures</li>
  <li>Learn card synergy</li>
  <li>Study elixir management</li>
  <li>See how strong win conditions are supported</li>
</ul>

<h2>⭐ Why This Site Exists</h2>
<p>
The idea behind the akomiya channel is simple: AI reviews decks made by real players.
</p>

<p>
This site exists to make that process clean and fair. Every deck is built using the same system, submitted in the same format, and analyzed under the same conditions.
</p>

<p>
It’s not just for sending decks to videos. It’s also a place to learn, experiment, and improve over time by studying real examples.
</p>

<p>
Whether you are just testing ideas for fun or trying to optimize for ladder and tournaments, this platform is meant to support your deck building through structured analysis and practical tools.
